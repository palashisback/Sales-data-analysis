# Sales-data-analysis

# Summary

This report contains the business analytics performed on the sales data for a client from Fiverr. Three separate analysis were performed in order to understand various facets of the sales data. These were:

- Market Segmentation - This was performed in order to gain a better understanding of the customers. The segmentation is based on the infamous RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) model and helps us to identify and target customer segments with appropriate products and marketing campaigns.

- Customer Churn analysis - Modelling customer churn in a non-contractual setting such as retail is a difficult problem as every transaction could a customer's last transaction. Here, an anomaly detection method is used to label customers spending pattern as normal or anamolous. This helps us identify customers who are most likely to churn and take actions to retain them.

- Market Basket Analysis - This analysis is based on a theory that if you buy a certain set of items, you are more or less likely to buy another set of items. Knowledge of such rules can really help drive the revenue up. Here the apriori algorithm is used to extract such rules from the sales data.


P.S. - I cannot include the rawdata used for this project due confidentiality reasons.
